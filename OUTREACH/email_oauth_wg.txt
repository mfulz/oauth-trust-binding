Subject: New Internet-Draft: OAuth Trust Binding Extension (OTBE)

To: oauth@ietf.org

Dear OAuth WG,

I would like to draw your attention to a newly submitted Internet-Draft:

    Title: OAuth Trust Binding Extension (OTBE)
    Filename: draft-fulz-oauth-trust-binding-00
    Link: <IETF_LINK>

The draft addresses a systemic gap in current OAuth and OpenID Connect deployments:
Authorization Servers can (and often do) assert identities for subjects who never
created an account with them, solely based on namespace ownership (e.g. email domains).
This creates silent impersonation risks, centralization concerns, and privacy implications.

OTBE introduces explicit user-controlled Trust Binding Records that allow Relying Parties
to verify that a Resource Owner has authorized a given AS to authenticate on their behalf.

Supporting material, including a developer guide and a regulatory whitepaper, is available at:

I welcome feedback, discussion, and potential consideration for WG adoption.

Best regards,
Matthias
