Subject: OAuth draft proposes solution to silent impersonation vulnerability

Hello,

A new Internet-Draft proposes the OAuth Trust Binding Extension (OTBE), addressing a
subtle but significant issue: Authorization Servers today can assert identities for
users who never registered with them, solely based on email-domain ownership. This
allows silent impersonation without user consent across third-party services that
accept, for example, “Sign in with X”.

Draft:
<IETF_LINK>

Technical and regulatory background:
<GITHUB_LINK>

This may be of interest for coverage, as it affects identity systems used by
hundreds of millions (if not billions) of people and intersects with privacy,
surveillance exposure, and identity centralization.

Regards,
Matthias
