Subject: Technical Finding: Federated Login Systems Permit Unobservable Identity Impersonation

Dear Supervisory Authority,

I would like to inform you of a systemic issue identified in widely used federated
login systems (OAuth/OpenID Connect). Current deployments allow Authorization Servers
to impersonate users across third-party services without the user's knowledge or consent,
based solely on control of an email domain.

A detailed technical and regulatory analysis is provided here:

A standardized solution (OAuth Trust Binding Extension, OTBE) has been submitted
to the IETF as an Internet-Draft:
<IETF_LINK>

This message is not a complaint against any specific organization, but aims to support
the development of privacy-preserving identity infrastructure and may be relevant to
your supervisory mandate (e.g., under GDPR principles of fairness, transparency and
data protection by design and by default).

I would welcome dialogue if this aligns with your current focus areas.

Kind regards,
Matthias
