Subject: Proposal: OAuth Trust Binding Extension — Request for Security Review

Hello,

I am reaching out with a newly published specification proposal:
OAuth Trust Binding Extension (OTBE).

Draft (IETF Internet-Draft):
<IETF_LINK>

Repository with additional material (developer guide, regulatory whitepaper):
<GITHUB_LINK>

OTBE addresses a long-standing but under-recognized issue in federated identity systems:
implicit trust of Authorization Servers based solely on email-domain control. This creates
silent impersonation vectors and unilateral identity assertions without explicit user consent.

The proposed extension is minimal, backward-compatible, and fully optional, but significantly
enhances privacy and reduces impersonation attack surfaces.

Given your organization's role in identity infrastructure, I would greatly value your
technical review and thoughts.

Best regards,
Matthias
